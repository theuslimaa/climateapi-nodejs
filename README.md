# SkyPulse - Developed with basic HTML, CSS, JS and Node.js!!

A simple page developed with the purpose to explore the frontend languages, HTML CSS and JavaScript. Utilizing two external APIs that i searched across the internet, the Google Maps API and WeatherAPI, i managed to make the climate data of whatever city to be showed on the website with climate data for the next 3 days as well.

To run the code, open the server.js file and, in the terminal, type "node server.js"
